## Project Tittle and Description : SOHO (Small Office Home Office) Network Design and Configuration on Cisco Paket Tracer.

This Project involves Designing and Implementing a Small Network for a Company using CISCO products. The network is structured to meet the following requirements:

    1. One router and one switch to be used (all CISCO products).

    2. 3 departments (Admin/IT, Finance/HR and Reception/CS). 

    3. Each department is required to be in different VLANS. 

    4. Each department is required to have wireless network for the users. 

    5. Host devices in the network are required to obtain IPv4 address automatically. 

    6. Devices in all the departments are required to communicate with each other. 

**Note:** Assume the ISP gave out a base network of **192.168.1.0**, you as the young network engineer who has been hired, design and implement a network considering the above requirements.
